These libraries have been developed and worked on for ages, are the gold standard of linear algebra vector and matrix computations, and their performance for a given machine are the benchmark used to determine which architecture is best for scientific computing—Intel and other CPU chip makers care very much about these benchmarks and make sure the code is as updated and optimal as humanly possible.\n",
