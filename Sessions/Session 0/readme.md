# Week 0
In preparation of tomorrow (test) meetup, please pay attention to the following:

1. If you can (access a fair laptop with a good internet connection), download prior to coming
anaconda for python programming via notebook (possibility to run R codes on it too)

https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
Note. It is quite heavy, 1GB+... but so powerful and versatile once installed (especially when leveraging on Juypter Notebook)

R Studio https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
+ R https://www.r-project.org/

It is also possible to run it all on the cloud via google's colab https://colab.research.google.com/
(which we will be using for ease of use). But sometimes, it is good practice to also have your code(s) stored locally on your laptop and run it via your git bash command line (+ server via npx serve command) or python simple http server

2. If you already have one, skip this and go to 3/
If not, please create a github account and ask to join or follow this repository where initial sources are stored (taken from AI Saturdays Lagos and Bagalore, ML developers repos, Elements of AI etc)
https://github.com/dnzengou/AI-Rwanda-meetup/blob/master/README.md

3. Go to github and/or fork or join the organization
